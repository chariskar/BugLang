# BugLang

**This is not a serious project.** It's a joke language I created to learn Rust. Expect bugs, incomplete features, and a whole lot of weirdness. 

## What is this?

 BugLang is a fun, experimental project designed to help me learn Rust while creating a ridiculous programming language. This language doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you. It’s mostly for fun, but who knows? Maybe you'll find it amusing (or frustrating).

## Features

- **Silly Syntax**: The language is intentionally bizarre and doesn’t follow conventional programming rules.
- **Rusty Code**: Written in Rust, the codebase is designed to help me learn Rust fundamentals.
- **Expect Bugs**: Since this is a joke, there are bound to be bugs. Feel free to report them if you want to, but don't expect them to be fixed anytime soon.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BugLang.git
   cd BugLang
   ```

2. Write your programs in BugLang and watch them break (or maybe work?).

3. build the code and try it

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute if you want to add more bugs or make the language even more nonsensical. Just keep in mind that this is a joke, so don’t expect anything to be polished.

## License

This project is licensed under the gplv3 License – but, again, it’s a joke, so don’t take it too seriously.
